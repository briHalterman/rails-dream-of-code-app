1. What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.

  Topics
  has_many :lesson_topics
  has_many :lessons through :lesson_topics

  LessonTopics (join table)
  belongs_to :topic
  belongs_to :lesson

2. What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on?

  Topics
  - title

  LessonTopics
  - lesson_id
  - topic_id

3. What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?

  Topics
  - id
  - created_at
  - updated_at

  LessonTopics
  - id
  - created_at
  - updated_at

4. Write out each table's name and column names with data types.

  Topics
  - id          integer
  - title       string
  - created_at  datetime
  - updated_at  datetime

  LessonTopics
  - id          integer
  - lesson_id   integer (foreign key to Lessons table)
  - topic_id    integer (foreign key to Topics table)
  - created_at  datetime
  - updated_at   datetime

5. Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file.

  bin/rails generate migration create_topics

9. Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file for the join table.

  bin/rails generate migration create_lesson_topics
